Considering the limited sequencing budget in single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments,
we optimize here the tradeoff between number of cells, and its consequential number of reads per cell,
in order to recover the trajectory of cells through temporal processes (e.g. cellular differentiation or reprogramming).



We test our analytical results on trajectories of diverse structures, for real and simulated single-cell datasets, and
show improvement in inferring trajectoryâ€™s structure and temporal gene expression patterns.
